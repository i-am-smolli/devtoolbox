## Inspiration

As a network engineer, I frequently rely on online tools for tasks like viewing certificates, exploring JSON structures, and converting text formats. While many excellent websites exist, I've often felt a degree of uncertainty about the security of my data when using third-party services. Additionally, some tools I've used appear to be less actively maintained.

This inspired the idea to build a personal toolbox ‚Äì a collection of utilities where I have full control over the data and the development process. DevToolbox is the result of this endeavor, built with transparency and user confidence in mind.

### Limiting belives

It's worth noting that a significant portion of this project (approximately 99.5%) was generated using AI-assisted coding (Vibe-Coding) using Firebase-Studio. While this accelerated development, there may be some initial bugs or areas for improvement. As a humble network engineer transitioning into development, I appreciate any feedback and contributions to refine the project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed (v18 or newer recommended). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **yarn:** These come bundled with Node.js or can be installed separately.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:9002`. Open this URL in your browser to see the application.

### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles the application and outputs the production-ready files into the `.next` directory.

### Running in Production Mode

After building the project, you can start it in production mode:

```bash
npm start
```

This will serve the optimized version of your application, typically on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port configured for Next.js production starts).

## Deploy using Kamal

Kamal will push pull to your own Docker Repository. It builds the container, uploads it and your server will pull it.

Copy `.example-env` to `.env` and change it values

`kamal setup` for inital setup of the container
or
`kamal deploy` if you are updating

## Project Structure

A brief overview of the key directories:

- `src/app/`: Contains all the pages and layouts for the application, following the Next.js App Router conventions.
  - `src/app/(tool-categories)/[tool-name]/page.tsx`: Specific tool page components.
  - `src/app/(tool-categories)/[tool-name]/layout.tsx`: Layouts for specific tools, often used for metadata.
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components.
  - `src/components/ui/`: ShadCN UI components.
